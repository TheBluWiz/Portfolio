# Portfolio
## Description
This portfolio will host links to my web applications and current proffesional information both so I can keep track of my progress and to be presented to potential employers. 

## Moving Forward
I aim to enchance the color scheme at a later point as well as adding additional hover states and tool tips to make the website feel more "lively".

## Deployed Site
